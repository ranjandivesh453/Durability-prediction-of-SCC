Instructions for Running the GUI Interface of XGBoost-WOA Model

Download and save the following files into a single folder:

gui_xgboost_woa.py

XGBoost_WOA_Sorptivity.pkl

XGBoost_WOA_RCPT.pkl

requirements_install.py

Download and install Anaconda for desktop from:
https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution

Launch Anaconda Navigator.

Open either Jupyter Notebook or VS Code from Anaconda Navigator.

Through the chosen platform, open the folder containing the files above.

Run the file requirements_install.py once to install the required Python packages.

After installation, run gui_xgboost_woa.py to launch the Concrete Properties Predictor using Hybrid XGBoost-WOA Algorithm.

In the GUI, enter the input SCC mixture parameters and click "Predict" to obtain the predicted values of:

Sorptivity (×10⁻⁴ mm/√s)

RCPT (Coulomb)

Use "Clear" to reset inputs, "Fill Sample" to auto-fill example values, or "Export CSV" to save results.
